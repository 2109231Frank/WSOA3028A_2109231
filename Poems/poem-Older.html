           <p>My body hurts more<br>
            The past seems blurrier yet is understood better<br>
            The days of running around in the sun for hours are behind me<br>
            Time does not wait for us, so we just grow older without realising it<br>
            <br>
            It is terrifying<br>
            <br>
            But what lightens the load is finding someone to love forevermore<br>
            Someone whose name seems charming to the last letter<br>
            I do not feel old, for you fill me with a youthful euphoria<br>
            I am not scared anymore, because I will share growing old with youâ€¦ every bit<br>
            And what we love about each other will like time, remain constant<br></p>

            <h3>Why I Wrote This</h3>
            I am personally terrified of growing old for some reason and this poem<br>
            is inspired by the fact that my girlfriend silences this fear of mine.<br>
            Since me and her started dating I have become more and more comfortable<br>
            with the idea of growing old (specifically alongside her).<br>
