        <P>
            The client who this artwork was made for contacted me
            and we had a consultation. She wanted something for her
            mother's new home. She explained that she had a massive
            flatscreen that they use as an art frame one their wall,
            and thus I painted her the piece and it is now displayed
            in HD quality in their home. She told me that her mum
            loved looking at the clouds and that sunrays remind her
            of her husband (who passed), I thus tried to create something
            that the client's mother could look at everyday and feel
            calm and happy.
        </P>
