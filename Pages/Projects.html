     <h2><center>My Ocean</center></h2>

    <article>
           <p>Tall waves crash on the beach seeming most intimidating<br> 
            Yet the deeper I go the calmer it seems<br>
            Beneath the ocean’s angry eruptions, she is silent, she is dark…<br>
            she is elegant<br>
            Sitting on the soft sand under the water staring into the murky abyss<br>
            I find tranquillity<br>
            I find love<br>
            For I know the life that the ocean hides<br> 
            I understand the respect she demands and deserves<br>
            When I step out from her ever pulling grasp<br>
            I long until I move into her again<br></p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <h3>Why I Wrote This</h3>
        I was inspired to write this poem a few weeks ago when I came back from<br>
        my girlfriend's house. It is essentially a poem about how me and her met<br>
        three years ago at a party.<br></p>

    <h2><center>Older</center></h2>
    <article>
           <p>My body hurts more<br>
            The past seems blurrier yet is understood better<br>
            The days of running around in the sun for hours are behind me<br>
            Time does not wait for us, so we just grow older without realising it<br>
            <br>
            It is terrifying<br>
            <br>
            But what lightens the load is finding someone to love forevermore<br>
            Someone whose name seems charming to the last letter<br>
            I do not feel old, for you fill me with a youthful euphoria<br>
            I am not scared anymore, because I will share growing old with you… every bit<br>
            And what we love about each other will like time, remain constant<br></p>
            
        <br>
        <p>
            <h3>Why I Wrote This</h3>
            I am personally terrified of growing old for some reason and this poem<br>
            is inspired by the fact that my girlfriend silences this fear of mine.<br>
            Since me and her started dating I have become more and more comfortable<br>
            with the idea of growing old (specifically alongside her).<br>

    <h2><center>Your're Not Here Anymore</center></h2> 
    <article>
           <p>
            Sometimes I stare at your window<br>
            But you are not there, not anymore<br>
            But I shall wait uncomplainingly<br>
            Wait for this torture to end<br>
            And for you to come back home to me<br> 
            For I miss you… and being without you is the lowest low<br>
            </p>
            
        <br>
        <p>
            <h3>Why I Wrote This</h3>
            When me and my girlfriend started dating each other we lived<br>
            on the same street, so we saw each other almost every day.<br>
            After a year or so she had to move because of work, and we<br>
            very soon started seeing each other every two months or so<br>
            if we were lucky. This poem was inspired by how much I miss<br>
            my girlfriend.<br>
