    <h2>STYLE GUIDE</h2>
        <p>
            For this website I want to keep it simple, I want a basic colour pallete that includes blue gray and white.
            My character is a very basic guy who made this websiteto share his views as well as to advertise his commision work,
            thus I want the site to look professional while keeping it apealingly simple. The only "walls of text" I'm planning
            to include are the blogs, the rest of the website is going to be tiny, bite-sized paragraphs. There might be an 
            animated background at some point, but for now I think the background is adequate at giving the site a bit more
            life than a blank background did.
        </p>

            <h2>CHARACTER</h2>
            <p>
                My character is essentially a middle aged man who is a freelance artist. He has a generally apathetic outlook on
                life and decided to launch this website because he does not have alot of friends to talk to. he advertises his
                art and writing services as well as writes about random topics he thinks of from time to time. The interactive media
                blogposts are posted as topics that the character finds interesting. The overall mood of this website is supposed to
                be relaxed or even lazy seeing that the character is a relaxed/lazy person.

            <h2>WIREFRAMES</h2>
            <p>
               Here are the wireframes of what I first thought I wanted this website to look like.<br>
               I will be updating the wireframe soon as I am not happy with how the wire frame looks.<br>
               After the wire frame is the pdf of my charcter template.<br>
           </p>
