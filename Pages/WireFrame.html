               Here is the wire frame of what I first thought I wanted this website to look like.<br>
               I will be updating the wireframe soon as I am not happy with how the wire frame looks.<br>
               After the wire frame is the pdf of my charcter template.<br>

           <h2>STYLE GUIDE</h2>
           <p>
               For this website I want to keep it simple, I want a basic colour pallete that includes blue gray and white.
               My character is a very basic guy who made this websiteto share his views as well as to advertise his commision work,
               thus I want the site to look professional while keeping it apealingly simple. The only "walls of text" I'm planning
               to include are the blogs, the rest of the website is going to be tiny, bite-sized paragraphs. There might be an 
               animated background at some point, but for now I think the background is adequate at giving the site a bit more
               life than a blank background did.
           </p>
