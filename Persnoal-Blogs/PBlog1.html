        Hi, my name is Mike Oxlung.<br>
        I am 30 years old as of last week, I have a degree in abstract art and on in poetry.<br>
        This degree was extremely cool for me to study, but the only part of it that actually<br>
        helped me find a job was the design aspect of it seeing that I ended up going into<br>
        marketing. I work for a company that shall remain unnamed in case I say some fucked<br>
        up stuff that they don't like. I don't exactly LOVE my job, but it does rake in a<br>
        decent amount of money so it's worth the struggles.<br></p>
        
        <p>I am the type of man that gets frustrated easily so this website of mine will definitely<br>
        be filled with rants and criticisms. I decided to make this website because the things<br>
        that I get passionate about tend to send me down rabbit-holes that annoy my companions<br>
        when I start talking. Feel free to interact with me (these services will be added soon)<br>
        and feel free to never come back here again - frankly, I don't give a crap either way.<br></p>
        
        <p>The things that interest me are:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Art.</li>
            <li>Poetry.</li>
            <li>Video Games.</li>
            <li>Music.</li>
            <li>Combat Sports.</li>
            <li>Bikes and Cars.</li>
        </ul>
        The that I hate are:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Politics.</li>
            <li>The News.</li>
            <li>Hipsters.</li>
            <li>Assholes.</li>
            <li>Cricket.</li>
            <li>Heat.</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p>So yeah, this is the end of my first blog. I am planning to treat this website<br>
        like a diary, so I shall add another entry when I feel like talking about something,<br>
        but for now, goodbye.<br></p>
