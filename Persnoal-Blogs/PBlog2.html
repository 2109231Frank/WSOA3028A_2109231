    So today I went to a cricket match with my girlfriend's dad (she wanted me to spend time with him).<br>
    For those of you who read my previous post you know that I absolutely hate cricket. It's so damn boring<br>
    for me to watch people hit balls with sticks, not to mention sometimes you watch the same match for<br>
    days at a time. I just don't understand how people find the sport interesting to watch.<br>
    <br>
    My girlfriend's dad loves cricket, and she bought two tickets so I had to go. It was one of the<br>
    worst days of my life, not only was it fucking hot out, but my girlfriend's dad was being a dick<br>
    like always. He has always been the type of person that brags about his success when you're in<br>
    a financial hole. The freelance work has not been going great (please let me sell you poems or art)<br>
    so, of course, he had to comment on that.<br>
    <br>
    Moral of the post is that cricket sucks, my girlfriend's dad is a dick and buy my services please<br>
    and thank you. I'll talk to you guys again soon.<br>
