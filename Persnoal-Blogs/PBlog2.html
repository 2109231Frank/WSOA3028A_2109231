    <p>
    So today I went to a cricket match with my girlfriend's dad (she wanted me to spend time with him).
    For those of you who read my previous post you know that I absolutely hate cricket. I just find it so 
    damn boring to watch people hit balls with sticks, not to mention sometimes you watch the same match for
    days at a time. I just don't understand how people find the sport interesting to watch.<br>
    <br>
    My girlfriend's dad loves cricket, and she bought two tickets so I had to go. It was one of the
    worst days of my life: not only was it fucking hot out, but my girlfriend's dad was being a dick
    as always. He has always been the type of person that brags about his success when you're in
    a financial hole. The freelance work has not been going great (please let me sell you poems or art)
    so, of course, he had to comment on that. To top everything off the man wanted to go to the Imperial Wanderers Stadium
    which is in Joburg. I live in Joburg and this means that I ofcourse had to bring him home with me after the game
    so that my girlfriend could hang with him too.<br>
    <br>
    Moral of the post is that cricket sucks, my girlfriend's dad is a dick and buy my services please
    and thank you. I'll talk to you guys again soon.<br>
