                This is going to be a short one. I have been struggling a lot recently with inspiration (not only with regards to my
                art and work). It has been a few months now where I just do not want to go outside anymore or do anything, but funilly
                enough the one thing that brought me out of my funk... Was and is corny Chuck Norris jokes. I have recently realized
                that there might be some of you guys who are struggling with the same issue and thus i decided to add random Chuck Norris
                jokes below. Be sure to come back whenever you want seeing that the jokes will be different each time!
