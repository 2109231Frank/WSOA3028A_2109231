           <p>Tall waves crash on the beach seeming most intimidating<br> 
            Yet the deeper I go the calmer it seems<br>
            Beneath the ocean’s angry eruptions, she is silent, she is dark…<br>
            she is elegant<br>
            Sitting on the soft sand under the water staring into the murky abyss<br>
            I find tranquillity<br>
            I find love<br>
            For I know the life that the ocean hides<br> 
            I understand the respect she demands and deserves<br>
            When I step out from her ever pulling grasp<br>
            I long until I move into her again<br></p>

            <h3>Why I Wrote This</h3>
        I was inspired to write this poem a few weeks ago when I came back from<br>
        my girlfriend's house. It is essentially a poem about how me and her met<br>
        three years ago at a party.<br></p>
