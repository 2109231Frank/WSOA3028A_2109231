           <p>
            Sometimes I stare at your window<br>
            But you are not there, not anymore<br>
            But I shall wait uncomplainingly<br>
            Wait for this torture to end<br>
            And for you to come back home to me<br> 
            For I miss youâ€¦ and being without you is the lowest low<br>
            </p>
            
        
        <p>
        <i>
            When me and my girlfriend started dating each other we lived<br>
            on the same street, so we saw each other almost every day.<br>
            After a year or so she had to move because of work, and we<br>
            very soon started seeing each other every two months or so<br>
            if we were lucky. This poem was inspired by how much I miss<br>
            my girlfriend.
