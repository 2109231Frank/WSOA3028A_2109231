            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p>
            Hey, my name is Mike Oxlung and I have decided<br>
            to express my views on certain things here seeing<br>
            that no one I know likes to talk about the things<br>
            that I find interesting.<br>

            I have written some insights to internet concepts<br>
            that I find interesting as well as random bullshit<br>
            that I have on my mind.<br>

            Feel free to ignore everything, but also<br>
            feel free to interact with anything.<br>
        </p>
        
            <h2>PROJECTS</h2>
        <p>
            The links on this page are to my personal<br>
            projects that I have created since starting<br>
            this website. They are mostly poems seeing<br>
            that I prefer writing poetry in my spare time.<br>
            Art is something i do for clients who want<br>
            something specific, and examples od these<br>
            will be in my WORK link that is on the home page.
