            Hey, my name is Mike Oxlung and I have decided<br>
            to express my views on certain things here seeing<br>
            that no one I know likes to talk about the things<br>
            that I find interesting.<br>

            I have written some insights to internet concepts<br>
            that I find interesting as well as random bullshit<br>
            that I have on my mind.<br>

            Feel free to ignore everything, but also<br>
            feel free to interact with anything.<br>
        </p>
