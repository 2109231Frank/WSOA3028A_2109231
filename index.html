            <h2>BRIEF INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>
            Hey, my name is Mike Oxlung and I have decided
            to express my views on certain things here seeing
            that no one I know likes to talk about the things
            that I find interesting.<br>

            I have written some insights on internet concepts
            that I find interesting as well as random bullshit
            that I have on my mind.<br>

            Feel free to ignore everything, but also
            feel free to interact with anything.<br>
            
            If you would like to know more about me
            then go to "PERSONAL" and read my first 
            blog post!
        </p>

            <h2>WHAT I DO IN MY SPARE TIME</h2>
        <p>
            The links below are to my personal
            projects that I have created since starting
            this website. They are mostly poems seeing
            that I prefer writing poetry in my spare time.
            Art is something I do for clients who want
            something specific, and examples of these
            will be lower down on the page.
