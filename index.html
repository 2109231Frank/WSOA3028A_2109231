            Hey, my name is Mike Oxlung and I have decided
            to express my views on certain things here seeing
            that no one I know likes to talk about the things
            that I find interesting.<br>

            I have written some insights to internet concepts
            that I find interesting as well as random bullshit
            that I have on my mind.<br>

            Feel free to ignore everything, but also
            feel free to interact with anything.<br>

            The links on this page are to my personal
            projects that I have created since starting
            this website. They are mostly poems seeing
            that I prefer writing poetry in my spare time.
            Art is something i do for clients who want
            something specific, and examples od these
            will be in my WORK link that is on the home page.

        These are some internet-based theories that I thought were interesting.
        I'm no expert on the web or any of the theories that I am discussing in
        the following few blogs, so don't quote me on anything. Some of the
        views that i express in the blogs are not my own and thus i take no credit.
