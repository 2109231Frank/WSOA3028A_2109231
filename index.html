           <p>Hey, my name is Mike Oxlung and I have decided<br>
           to express my views on certain things here seeing<br>
           that no one I know likes to talk about the things<br>
           that I find interesting.<br>
           I have written some insights to internet concepts<br>
           that I find interesting as well as random bullshit<br>
           that I have on my mind.<br>
           Feel free to ignore everything, but also<br>
           feel free to interact with anything.<br></p>
           
           <p>Also I do commission work, so if you would like<br>
           an original poem written by me or an artwork<br>
           made by me, contact me for a consultation.<br>
           The following image is one of my most recent<br>
           commissioned works and it's called 'A Glimpse Of Heaven'.<br></p>
