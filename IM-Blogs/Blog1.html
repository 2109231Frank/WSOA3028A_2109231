        <h2><center>Blog 1 - The Library Of Babel(1962)</center></h2>
        <hr/>
        <p>The library of Babel is a short story that was written in 1941 by Argentinian author Jorge Luis Borges. The story was then<br>
        translated to English in 1962. The library of Babel is a universe that consists of hexagonal rooms that are attached to each<br>
        other; these rooms have a passageway in two of the walls and bookshelves on the other four. Each bookshelf consists of 410-page<br>
        books that include a seemingly random combination of the 22 letters, a coma, a period and a space. Most of these books are<br>
        incoherent, but the total of all the books (that are speculated to be an infinite amount) possess unbelievably valuable<br>
        information: Seeing that the library has every combination of the 25 characters mentioned above it has every book ever written,<br>
        every book that possibly will be written as well as every possible translation of these books. <br></p>
        
        <p>Seeing that the librarians of this universe cannot distinguish fact from fiction between the infinite amount of information and<br>
        gibberish within the books; they are in a constant despair. Some librarians revert to drastic behaviours such as burning every<br>
        book they deem nonsense and searching for “the man of the book” who is the librarian that has found the book that a perfectly<br>
        coherent index/map of the library.<br></p>
        
        <p>Comparing the library of Babel to the internet one cannot help but to notice certain relations. The internet is a vast web of<br>
        information that is littered with nonsense and us (the librarians) can easily get lost within the noise and the gibberish while<br>
        searching for answers or information. Just like the drastic behaviour of the cult like librarians who destroy “pointless” books<br>
        there are those among us whose mission is censoring parts of the internet that they deem unworthy of existence. Within the library<br>
        it is impossible to find factual knowledge without knowing that it is in fact, fact; you can thus only find useful information on<br>
        topics you already know and understand while looking in areas of the library where you know the necessary books are. This is also<br>
        a lot like the internet seeing that searching for information on certain topics you need to already have an idea of the topic<br>
        allowing you to use appropriate wording on your search (otherwise you will be digging through a seemingly infinite amount of rubbish).<br></p>
