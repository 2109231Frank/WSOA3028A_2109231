        <h1><center>Blog 1 - The Library Of Babel(1962)</center></h1>
        The library of Babel is a short story that was written in 1941 by Argentinian author Jorge Luis Borges. The story was then translated to English in 1962.<br>
        The library of Babel is a universe that consists of hexagonal rooms that are attached to each other; these rooms have a passageway in two of the walls and<br>
        bookshelves on the other four. Each bookshelf consists of 410-page books that include a seemingly random combination of the 22 letters, a coma, a period<br>
        and a space. Most of these books are incoherent, but the total of all the books (that are speculated to be an infinite amount) possess unbelievably valuable<br>
        information: Seeing that the library has every combination of the 25 characters mentioned above it has every book ever written, every book that possibly will<br>
        be written as well as every possible translation of these books. <br>
        <br>
        Seeing that the librarians of this universe cannot distinguish fact from fiction between the infinite amount of information and gibberish within the books;<br>
        they are in a constant despair. Some librarians revert to drastic behaviours such as burning every book they deem nonsense and searching for “the man of the book”<br>
        who is the librarian that has found the book that a perfectly coherent index/map of the library.<br>
        <br>
        Comparing the library of Babel to the internet one cannot help but to notice certain relations. The internet is a vast web of information that is littered<br>
        with nonsense and us (the librarians) can easily get lost within the noise and the gibberish while searching for answers or information. Just like the<br>
        drastic behaviour of the cult like librarians who destroy “pointless” books there are those among us whose mission is censoring parts of the internet<br>
        that they deem unworthy of existence. Within the library it is impossible to find factual knowledge without knowing that it is in fact, fact;<br>
        you can thus only find useful information on topics you already know and understand while looking in areas of the library where you know the<br>
        necessary books are. This is also a lot like the internet seeing that searching for information on certain topics you need to already have an<br>
        idea of the topic allowing you to use appropriate wording on your search (otherwise you will be digging through a seemingly infinite amount of rubbish).<br>
