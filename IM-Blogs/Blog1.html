            <h2>THE LIBRARY OF BABEL</h2>
        <p>The library of Babel is a short story that was written in 1941 by Argentinian author Jorge Luis Borges. The story was then
        translated to English in 1962. The library of Babel is a universe that consists of hexagonal rooms that are attached to each
        other; these rooms have a passageway in two of the walls and bookshelves on the other four. Each bookshelf consists of 410-page
        books that include a seemingly random combination of the 22 letters, a coma, a period and a space. Most of these books are
        incoherent, but the total of all the books (that are speculated to be an infinite amount) possess unbelievably valuable
        information: Seeing that the library has every combination of the 25 characters mentioned above it has every book ever written,
        every book that possibly will be written as well as every possible translation of these books. </p>
        
        <p>Seeing that the librarians of this universe cannot distinguish fact from fiction between the infinite amount of information and
        gibberish within the books; they are in a constant despair. Some librarians revert to drastic behaviours such as burning every
        book they deem nonsense and searching for “the man of the book” who is the librarian that has found the book that a perfectly
        coherent index/map of the library.</p>
        
        <p>Comparing the library of Babel to the internet one cannot help but to notice certain relations. The internet is a vast web of
        information that is littered with nonsense and us (the librarians) can easily get lost within the noise and the gibberish while
        searching for answers or information. Just like the drastic behaviour of the cult like librarians who destroy “pointless” books
        there are those among us whose mission is censoring parts of the internet that they deem unworthy of existence. Within the library
        it is impossible to find factual knowledge without knowing that it is in fact, fact; you can thus only find useful information on
        topics you already know and understand while looking in areas of the library where you know the necessary books are. This is also
        a lot like the internet seeing that searching for information on certain topics you need to already have an idea of the topic
        allowing you to use appropriate wording on your search (otherwise you will be digging through a seemingly infinite amount of rubbish).<br></p>
