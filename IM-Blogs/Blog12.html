                <h2>ETHICAL IMPLEMENTATIONS OF UX/UI</h2>
        <p>
            In this blog I shall be looking at the ethical implementations of UX in web development. Ethics refer to the moral 
            principles that control a person’s behaviour or govern an activity or an action. UX design refer to the design of 
            a website or product with a user’s experience and thinking in mind. Designers use this form of design in an attempt 
            to improve user satisfaction or even influence a user’s decision-making process. This is usually done by controlling 
            the user’s freedom, in other words designers can control the spectrum between complete user freedom or forcing users 
            to just be along for the ride.
        </p>
          
        <p>   
            UX designers do their jobs by studying the thought patterns of users, they then use this information in order to design 
            an effective website. These designers do this by controlling the flow or layout of the website which in turn influences 
            how the user thinks and acts when navigating through the site. Now, why should one care about these ethics? Well from a 
            business standpoint we can understand that designers want to avoid making users feel controlled or uncomfortable when 
            using their site. When users are unsatisfied with a website or app they will talk about it, and this will result in a 
            complete product fail. Designers need to keep this in mind in order to do use ethics and UX design effectively, designers 
            need to be careful when influencing users, because users can very quickly get annoyed with a site or app when being 
            bombarded with prompt to review etc. whilst designing, we need to ask ourselves questions regarding ethics almost every 
            step of the way, this will allow us to improve the overall satisfaction between the target users.
        </p>
        
        <p>   
            In conclusion, UX designers have access to information that will allow them to influence users, however this leaves the 
            designers with the responsibility to not go overboard and to focus on the satisfaction and comfort of users whilst using 
            their product, instead of causing the users to feel forced into actions. Thus, Ethics and UX design should go hand in hand 
            if UX designers have any hope of creating a successful website or app.
