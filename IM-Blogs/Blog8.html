            The digital divide is basically the gap between people who have access to modern technology and digital media, and those who
            who do not, or those who have restricted access to these technologies and media. In this post I shall discuss the different
            digital divides, their causes and their impact on us.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            In a world where technologie is everywhere it is difficult to beieve that there are still people without full access to
            these technologies and the internet in general. Unfortunately this is a reality, and here are some reasons for this divide:
            Firtly we have education, education is one of the biggest reasons that people are tapping into the internet. Seeing that
            there are still so many areas in the world where the people get poor or no education it leaves a well of individuals who
            do not undesratnd technology and thus can't possibly exploit the full potential of the internet. Another reason for the
            divide is income, low-income earners are less likely to have computers or internet at home than high-income earners. Low-income
            earners view technology as a luxury, and thus these people are less likely to discover the internet and its vast well of resources.
            The last reason that I will discuss is geographical restrictions, what this basically is, is the fact that more developed 
            countries have access to a wider variety of technology as well as high-speed broadband connections. Richer countries are thus 
            more likely to explore different technologies, medias and the internet as a whole than more rural countries, and this impacts 
            the digital divide quite a bit.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            According to the Nielsen Norman Group, there are three stages/types of digital divides. The economic divide is explained as 
            some people simply just can't afford computers or efficient internet. This type of divide is more relevant in underdeveloped
            countries than in first world countries, and this shall probably remain the case for the forseeable future. Next we have the 
            usability divide which is the fact that so many people in the world do not know how most technologies work. Even if these
            individuals were given a computer they probably would not know how to use it or exploit its full potential. Lastly is the
            empowerment divide, and this divide is the most difficult divide to fix, it involvesthe fact that a small minority of internet
            users contribute to the growth and improvement of the internet experience, this leaves so many people who don't quite understand
            how to use certain aspects of the web at the mercy of people who actually contribute. This divide is mainly because of people's
            lack of eductation on the matter which is slowly being improved in certain parts of the globe.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Education is one of the areas where the effects of the digital devide is clear, seeing that the internet is a well of 
            information and resources, it results in rural countries that lack technology having an inafective education system
            seeing that technologically advanced countries are getting smarter with regards to tech and the internet, while These
            rural countries are getting less effective education rapidly. The lack of internet skills can also handicap people 
            with regards to finding jobs and oppertunities in the industrial and developing world.  The digital divide is thus 
            a terrible reality that results in people being held back while the rest of the world is growing and becoming more advanced.<br>
