                <h2>SEMANTIC MARKUP</h2>
        <p>Semantic markup or semantic HTML is HTML that gives elements within a webpage meaning rather than just changing how the elements
        look. An Example of a tag that is not semantic markup is the tag to make text bold seeing that it only makes something appear
        bold, thus not adding any additional meaning to the element that is now bold. The "strong" tag would be semantic markup because
        it tells the browser that the enclosed element is emphasized, and thus does not only change the appearance of the enclosed element
        but also adds additional information or meaning to said element.<br></p>
        
        <p>The reason why one should use semantic markup is the fact it communicates to browsers what the webpage is about, by adding
        additional information and meaning to certain markups. This is important because it helps the browser know what is in your
        webpage without opening it, thus improving your webpageâ€™s chances of appearing high on the search results seeing that browsers
        share this information with search engines. Semantic markup is also a very convenient way of styling your web page seeing that
        you can change every element that is enclosed in the same semantic tag with CSS instead of styling them individually. Sematic
        markup is also important for communicating with text to speech programs seeing that it communicates additional meaning to these
        programs, thus improving how the webpage is being read.<br></p>
        
        <p>Semantic markup is thus an important part of designing for the web seeing that it not only helps people figure out what information
        on your page is valuable, but it also allows browsers and search engines to push your webpage higher up in their search results thus
        helping you reach your target audience.<br></p>
