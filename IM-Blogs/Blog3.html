        Semantic markup or semantic HTML is HTML that gives elements within a webpage meaning rather than just changing how the elements<br>
        look. An Example of a tag that is not semantic markup is the tag to make text bold seeing that it only makes something appear<br>
        bold, thus not adding any additional meaning to the element that is now bold. The "strong" tag would be semantic markup because<br>
        it tells the browser that the enclosed element is emphasized, and thus does not only change the appearance of the enclosed element<br>
        but also adds additional information or meaning to said element.<br>
        <br>
        The reason why one should use semantic markup is the fact it communicates to browsers what the webpage is about, by adding<br>
        additional information and meaning to certain markups. This is important because it helps the browser know what is in your<br>
        webpage without opening it, thus improving your webpageâ€™s chances of appearing high on the search results seeing that browsers<br>
        share this information with search engines. Semantic markup is also a very convenient way of styling your web page seeing that<br>
        you can change every element that is enclosed in the same semantic tag with CSS instead of styling them individually. Sematic<br>
        markup is also important for communicating with text to speech programs seeing that it communicates additional meaning to these<br>
        programs, thus improving how the webpage is being read.<br>
        <br>
        Semantic markup is thus an important part of designing for the web seeing that it not only helps people figure out what information<br>
        on your page is valuable, but it also allows browsers and search engines to push your webpage higher up in their search results thus<br>
        helping you reach your target audience.<br>
