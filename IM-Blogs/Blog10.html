                <h2>ANALYSIS OF MY OWN UX</h2>
        <p>
            The way that I designed my site was with some casual UX in mind, UX design in the corporate world involves 
            creating a unique brand specific design across the website. I have not done this seeing that I am just starting 
            out, the UX design that I had in mind was with regards to ease of use when on my site. I tried making the layout 
            logical and casual by recently making the main page include all aspects of my website, I made the colours of my 
            website soft with no drastic contrasts so that it is not hard on the eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first prototype that I created was tested with 2 test users, on in their twenties and one elderly as to make 
            sure that it is both interesting enough for someone who is used to using technology and at the same time simple 
            enough for someone who does not have a lot of affinity to technology.  The first tester (user in their twenties) 
            had little issues with the website, they pointed out that the site was a little boring, which I tried to fix by 
            adding a gradient background which I hoped would make the website more interesting to look at. The second tester 
            (elderly user) had a lot of trouble navigating the website, which is why I decided to add all the main pages to one 
            big landing page, this made the site a lot simpler, and both the testing-users were pleased with this change that I 
            have made.
        </p>
        <p>
            I personally like the way my website looks, but I feel like I failed in making it remarkably interesting, I wanted 
            to add pictures or an animated background, but I prioritized other aspects of the website. I will however add these 
            soon enough.
