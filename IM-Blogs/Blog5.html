                <h2>INTERNET BOTS</h2>
        <p>Internet robots or bots are software applications that complete automated tasks across the internet. These tasks are generally
        simple or repetitive, bots are used in this regard because they can perform repetitive tasks at a higher efficiency than human
        beings. One of the most common use of internet bots is spidering which is when bots get, file and analyze information from web
        servers. These servers can include their own files which dictate what the “spider” bots can and can’t do. Bots have a much
        better reaction time and efficiency than humans, which is why they are often also used in videogames and auction sites. Bots
        can also be programmed to emulate human speech in the form of text chat and are therefore sometimes used as real time web
        assistants on certain websites.<br></p>
        
        <p>Bots were first invented in 1988 when internet relay chats became popular, these bots would sit in chat rooms in order to prevent
        the chat rooms to close due to inactivity. Internet crawlers or spiderbots were the next step in the history of internet bots
        and were introduced to the web in 1994. Unfortunately, bots were very quickly used maliciously in the form of trojan and worm
        software and these were first introduced into the IRC network in 1999 with the purpose to secretly install themselves on machines
        where they would sit in IRC channels and wait for their commands. In 2000 the GTbot emerged in the IRC network and was the first
        botnet program that could execute denial of service attacks on victim’s computers, this botnet program would, in a few years,
        be able to perform ransomware and information theft attacks. Botnet programs very quickly became the favourite tool for internet
        hackers and in 2007 on of the biggest botnet programs came to life. This botnet was called “Storm” and would go on to infect around
        50 million machines and was used in stock price fraud, identity theft and various other crimes.<br></p>
       
        <p>Bots are not exclusively malicious though seeing that the internet would be extremely difficult to navigate without them.
        Internet crawler bots scour millions of pages in order for you to find the most applicable site for what you’ve searched.
        Chat bots have also become vital in managing text chat in a lot of sites. Bots have helped shaped the internet into the powerful
        tool it is today, but they also pose a huge threat to the public when influenced, accessed or created by people with malicious
        intentions.<br></p>
