        <h2><center>Blog 5 - A Brief Look At Internet Bots</center></h2>
        <hr/>
        Internet robots or bots are software applications that complete automated tasks across the internet. These tasks are generally<br>
        simple or repetitive, bots are used in this regard because they can perform repetitive tasks at a higher efficiency than human<br>
        beings. One of the most common use of internet bots is spidering which is when bots get, file and analyze information from web<br>
        servers. These servers can include their own files which dictate what the “spider” bots can and can’t do. Bots have a much<br>
        better reaction time and efficiency than humans, which is why they are often also used in videogames and auction sites. Bots<br>
        can also be programmed to emulate human speech in the form of text chat and are therefore sometimes used as real time web<br>
        assistants on certain websites.<br>
        <br>
        Bots were first invented in 1988 when internet relay chats became popular, these bots would sit in chat rooms in order to prevent<br>
        the chat rooms to close due to inactivity. Internet crawlers or spiderbots were the next step in the history of internet bots<br>
        and were introduced to the web in 1994. Unfortunately, bots were very quickly used maliciously in the form of trojan and worm<br>
        software and these were first introduced into the IRC network in 1999 with the purpose to secretly install themselves on machines<br>
        where they would sit in IRC channels and wait for their commands. In 2000 the GTbot emerged in the IRC network and was the first<br>
        botnet program that could execute denial of service attacks on victim’s computers, this botnet program would, in a few years,<br>
        be able to perform ransomware and information theft attacks. Botnet programs very quickly became the favourite tool for internet<br>
        hackers and in 2007 on of the biggest botnet programs came to life. This botnet was called “Storm” and would go on to infect around<br>
        50 million machines and was used in stock price fraud, identity theft and various other crimes.<br>
        <br>
        Bots are not exclusively malicious though seeing that the internet would be extremely difficult to navigate without them.<br>
        Internet crawler bots scour millions of pages in order for you to find the most applicable site for what you’ve searched.<br>
        Chat bots have also become vital in managing text chat in a lot of sites. Bots have helped shaped the internet into the powerful<br>
        tool it is today, but they also pose a huge threat to the public when influenced, accessed or created by people with malicious<br>
        intentions.<br>
