                <h2>UX ANALYSIS</h2>
        <p>
            Before we look at different methods of analysing UX we must first take a brief look at what UX is. UX or
            user experience is a design process that designers or design teams use in order to create a relevant experience
            for users. This design process involves the product branding, overall function, design and usability. UX design
            is an immensly important aspect of design seeing that when you don't design something with user experience in
            mind, then users will seldom be satisfied or comfortable using your product. As a designer one must think of what
            users are going to do and think even before they touch their device.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to effectively design something with UX in mind we have to do user experience research to inform almost
            all of our design decisions. UX research is a method of grounding design ideas in reality and improving the overall
            user satisfaction. Boiled down UX research is just using observation, analysis and feedback to figure out how users
            think and act, and this is done using qualitive and quantive resesearch.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many methods for UX research or UX analysis, for example: First click testing, which is testing that is
            focused on site navigation and can be done on a basic prototype or even a wireframe. Focus groups are discussions
            with groups of users that help designers gain insight on the overall feedback, ideas, and desires from users. An Expert
            review is a great method of knowing where to improve on your site or product seeing that it involves a usability expert
            looking at your project with a set of previously established guidelines and benchmarks. Surveys have always been a great
            way of finding out who visits your site and what their overall experience or attitude towards your project is. Usibility
            testing is where a user performs tasks on your site while you observe, this reveals user frustrations or confusions and
            show you as a designer where to improve the UX of your site.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many diffirent ways of analysing the user experience of your site or product, but the trick is to not do the
            research as an afterthought. As a designer you need to monitor the UX research every step of the design process in order
            to design effectively and to build a site with the optimal levels of user satisfaction by being well informed before
            making any important design decisions.<br>
