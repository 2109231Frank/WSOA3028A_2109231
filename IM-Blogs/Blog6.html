            Before we look at different methods of analysing UX we must first take a brief look at what UX is. UX or<br>
            user experience is a design process that designers or design teams use in order to create a relevant experience<br>
            for users. This design process involves the product branding, overall function, design and usability. UX design<br>
            is an immensly important aspect of design seeing that when you don't design something with user experience in<br>
            mind, then users will seldom be satisfied or comfortable using your product. As a designer one must think of what<br>
            users are going to do and think even before they touch their device.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to effectively design something with UX in mind we have to do user experience research to inform almost<br>
            all of our design decisions. UX research is a method of grounding design ideas in reality and improving the overall<br>
            user satisfaction. Boiled down UX research is just using observation, analysis and feedback to figure out how users<br>
            think and act, and this is done using qualitive and quantive resesearch.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many methods for UX research or UX analysis, for example: First click testing, which is testing that is<br>
            focused on site navigation and can be done on a basic prototype or even a wireframe. Focus groups are discussions<br>
            with groups of users that help designers gain insight on the overall feedback, ideas, and desires from users. An Expert<br>
            review is a great method of knowing where to improve on your site or product seeing that it involves a usability expert<br>
            looking at your project with a set of previously established guidelines and benchmarks. Surveys have always been a great<br>
            way of finding out who visits your site and what their overall experience or attitude towards your project is. Usibility<br>
            testing is where a user performs tasks on your site while you observe, this reveals user frustrations or confusions and<br>
            show you as a designer where to improve the UX of your site.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many diffirent ways of analysing the user experience of your site or product, but the trick is to not do the<br>
            research as an afterthought. As a designer you need to monitor the UX research every step of the design process in order<br>
            to design effectively and to build a site with the optimal levels of user satisfaction by being well informed before<br>
            making any important design decisions.<br>
