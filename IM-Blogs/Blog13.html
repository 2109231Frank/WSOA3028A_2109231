                <h2>THE PROMISE AND PERIL OF UGC</h2>
        <p>
            What is user generated content (UGC)? It is basically any content such as: music, text, reviews, videos, images etc. 
            That is created by people instead of brands and big industries. Companies usually share this content on their own 
            social media accounts as marketing. An example of this is when a clothing brand shares content made by people wearing 
            their brand on the brand’s Instagram page.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is obviously great marketing seeing that people from the general public making content that include your product; 
            would increase the product credibility with regard to marketing. This can also expose your product’s flaws seeing that 
            the people who make this content do not have to be biased, because they are not getting paid. In other words: when 
            someone does not like your product, they are allowed to make a video of themselves explaining why they do not like your 
            product, and this may negatively impact your overall popularity or interest.
        </p>
        <p>
            Humanizing your brand or business is key to marketing because the public is more likely to give you attention when it seems 
            like they are interacting with human beings instead of a corporation. In 2019 Stackla reported that around 79% of people 
            admitted that user generated content “highly” influenced their purchasing choices and consumer behaviours. That being said: 
            UGC also means risk seeing that abusive content. This abusive content could be from individuals who enjoy “trolling” online 
            or it can be instigated by competing brands. This toxic, abusive or deceiving content has the potential to really hurt a 
            brand seeing that it deters the public from supporting you, has the potential to scare away investors and pushes away advertisers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ultimately, it’s clear that using user generated content can be a double-edged sword. UGC has the potential to humanize 
            your brand and massively increase your popularity and interactions with the general public, but it can also be damaging 
            to your credibility. Abusive user generated content can destroy a brand’s credibility and can deter the public from 
            considering a brand when they have so many others to choose from.
