                <h2>WHAT IS AN INTERNET BROWSER?</h2>
        <p>
            A web browser is a program that has a graphical user interface which is used to view and navigate between web pages. 
            In other words, it is a program that is used to navigate the internet. When a user requests a web page from a website, 
            the browser that is being used will get the necessary information and content from the web server and will then display 
            the website to the user.
        </p>
        <p>
            Web browsers are often confused with search engines; search engines are essentially websites that provide you access to 
            other websites, but in order to gain access to web servers and view any websites you will need a web browser. To simplify 
            this concept, I shall give you examples of search engines and web browsers: a search engine would be Google 
            (www.google.com) and one would access this website in Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge.
        </p>
        <p>
            A web browser essentially works like this: the web browser displays the home page of a search engine where the user can type key words 
            into a search bar to find the website that they desire. The browser has a rendering engine which is responsible for 
            rendering the HTML, XML, images, and CSS that is then generated in the user interface and displays web pages. The browser 
            then uses various networking protocols to handle internet communication and security and will usually try to minimize 
            internet traffic through implementing an accumulation of retrieved documents. Browsers include a JavaScript interpreter 
            which is responsible for executing embedded JavaScript code in websites which is then rendered for the user. A UI backend 
            is usually used in browsers to show a generic interface that is not platform specific. Finally, data storage refers to 
            browser storage mechanisms which is created in the local drive where the browser is installed and is responsible for 
            managing user data.
