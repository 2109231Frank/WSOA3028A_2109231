        <p>YouTube was registered in 2005 by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley and Jawed Karim. The three men wanted YouTube to be a space where<br>
        ordinary people could share home videos for people to watch and enjoy. During the beta time period (May 2005) the site had<br>
        up to 30 000 visitors a day and by the time it officially launched (December 2005) the site had over two million visits a day.<br>
        It took merely one month for YouTube to have more than twenty-five million users and was producing 20 000 new videos a day and<br>
        by July of 2006 YouTube had a hundred million videos being watched every day. These numbers did not slow down. This immense<br>
        growth in users meant the owners of YouTube could not keep up with the hardware and broadband connections and could not afford<br>
        the upkeep of the site, thus they started looking for someone to buy the site. In November of 2006 Google bought YouTube for<br>
        1.65 billion U.S. dollars in stock. It is at this point that YouTube included the copyrighted content agreement, which allowed<br>
        youtubers to include certain copyrighted music in their videos, YouTube also removed tens of thousands of copyrighted videos<br>
        from the site to avoid copyright lawsuits. In 2008 Google struck a deal with MGM to play some of their videos on YouTube with<br>
        advertisements running alongside the videos.<br></p>
        
        <p>YouTube has been a massive internet sensation and source of entertainment since it was created. This site sparked the era that<br>
        was slowly but surely making television obsolete seeing that it is a free site where users can watch exactly what they wanted<br>
        to with a seemingly endless well of videos to watch. YouTube also became a source of useful information since tutorial and<br>
        educational videos were starting to circle. This made it possible for anyone with internet access to learn almost anything.<br>
        YouTube has had its share of controversies over the years, which is expected from a public platform’ but it still remains<br>
        a massive part of internet culture.<br></p>
        
        <p>I feel that this was an important period in the history of the internet seeing that it very quickly became a massive part of<br>
        a lot of the global population’s lives as it is many of our main source of entertainment and a big part of people’s home<br>
        education (tutorial videos that teach watchers how to do certain thing that you could only learn at certain schools or companies<br>
        before YouTube became a reality.<br></p>
