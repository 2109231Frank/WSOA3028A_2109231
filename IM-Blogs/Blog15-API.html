                <h2>MY EXTERNAL DEPENDANCY</h2>
        <p>
            The external dependancy that I used was a free json API from api.chucknorris.io and generates random Chuck Norris
            jokes. I resorted to using this external dependancy (which was shown in class) because i could not figure out how
            to implement a number of other ones. I first wanted to include a weather API in a blogpost where the character 
            complains about the unpredictability of weather in Johannesburg, but I could not figure out how to use the weather
            API's that I found. Next I wanted to use a similar API to the Chuck Norris one. This API would display a random 
            insperational quote each time the home screen is loaded. This API was designed for Python and I could not figure out
            how to use this in time.
        </p>
        <p>
            I used the Chuck Norris API because it was the only one that I understood how to use. I tried to make the use of this API 
            appropriate by including it in a new personal blogpost. I also attempted to make the use of the API unique than the use
            displayed in the lecture by linking it to a button that the user can click every time they want a new random joke. I have
            looked at many ways to include API's into a website, but struggled to find an API that does not need to be payed for. I 
            personally think that the API I used, was used in an appropriately all things considered. The overall necessity of my external
            dependancy lies within it's abillity to strengthen my character. I believe that it makes my character a bit more real, but 
            it does not make my website more advanced overall.
