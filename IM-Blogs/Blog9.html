                <h2>INFORMATION GEOGRAPHIES</h2>
        <p>
            In Graham et al’s “Toward a study of information geographies”, Graham, Sabbata and Zook discuss the inequalities of the 
            generation of information across the globe by linking their arguments to geography. These arguments or points are being 
            substantiated and influenced by political, geographical, social and societal issues. The core question of this piece is 
            where and from whom does the information originate, where does this information go, where and why is it changed or altered
             and finally what does it all lead to.<br>
            Graham explains that there is massively uneven access to certain modes of communication or digital medias, uneven 
            geographies of participation in information generation and huge inequalities in representation in said information. 
            These issues are more often than not amplified as technology advances and new forms of communication arise, since certain 
            geographical hotspots don’t have access to a lot of the “base” forms of communication in the world today. This problem 
            plays back to the question of where the information if coming from seeing that there are geographical spots that contribute 
            little to no information into the world. People, businesses and services that do not contribute to modern information get 
            left behind or become invisible to the rest of the world that do in fact receive and contribute to modern information 
            (for example: businesses in rural areas that do not put themselves on the internet will be “invisible” to those of us that 
            search for businesses on google).<br>
            Geographical information distribution has been a mode of power formation and control, explains Graham. This can be explained 
            by maps; when you look at different types of maps over the years, we can see that they are heavily influenced by the politics 
            and the distributed information at the time of generation, some of these maps will have distorted or non-existent views on 
            geographical spots that contribute less to information generation and distribution. The paper later explains how these 
            constraints manifest in the representation of the dominant. In other words, through the generation of information these dominant 
            representations control, in a sense, political, social, and economic power. Graham explains that it is possible in our digital 
            age that older hierarchies of dominant representation could be broken down or democratised seeing that the ease of use of modern 
            forms of media could be a radical change in the “political economy of information”. In other words, through modern forms of media 
            citizens and consumers play a more direct and important roll in the shaping, mediating, and augmenting of the information that is 
            consumed and distributed, this in turn removes some power from the more traditional mediators of information, and thus allows less 
            inequality in the generation, distribution, and representation of/in information. In theory this should open up different 
            geographies of participation and representation that are more equal across the globe than it has ever been.<br>
            In this paper the authors look at three main types of geographies, namely: geographies access and enablement, geographies of 
            participation and geographies of representation. Access to the internet and digital technologies lie at the heart of these three 
            geographies. The geographical figures shown in the paper show us that first world countries have high percentages of access to the 
            internet (more citizens) and more third world countries have little access and in some geographical spots almost no access. Through 
            data provided we can clearly see the inequalities across the globe with regards to information access, contribution, and 
            representation. The paper explains that the core observations is that this geographical inequality is being reinforced by new 
            information technologies rather being alleviated by them.  In order to change this inequality, we need to, according to Graham, 
            deconstruct, disentangle the mutability and immutability of information, map, and integrate the geographies of information and 
            finally we are going to need to ask critical questions about power. This paper reveals that the geographical information 
            inequalities are not changing any time soon, but the paper does point out the key areas where we need to change our information 
            distribution, creation and representation.
