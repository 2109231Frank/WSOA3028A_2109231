                <h2>IMPLICIT BIAS AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT</h2>
        <p>
            So, I took an IAT (Implicit Association Test) on the implicit bias website. The test that I took involved sexual 
            preference, the test entailed that I press buttons to sort words and figures into categories, like straight and 
            gay or good and bad, they later on put gay and good in one category and straight and bad in the other and then 
            switched the two later on.
        </p>
        <p>
            I felt extremely uncomfortable categorizing bad and straight things together and also with gay and bad things, 
            it felt really brain-washy in a sense. I understand that the tests are for educational purposes and should not 
            be taking too seriously, but that being said it still made me uncomfortable to answer the questions in the way 
            that they wanted me to. I do think it is important to understand your personal bias if you are going to design a 
            website proper usability. We need to acknowledge our biases in order to counteract them so that we can create 
            subjectively. If a web developer, for example, is biased with regards to politics he or she might design a website 
            that is subconsciously leaned towards one pole of the political scale that would, in turn, make the site feel 
            unfriendly or less inclusive to the users that are of a different political standpoint. This is why this specific 
            user should figure out and understand his or her political bias in order to avoid funnelling their users and losing 
            potential future users.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even though this test made me uncomfortable and the results (that I shall keep private) did not exactly tell me 
            anything that will help me improve my site: I believe that this is just the case because of my personal feelings, 
            and I think that other tests would be more applicable to web development and to counteract my personal biases. I will 
            conclude this post by saying that I believe that it is extremely important for web developers to figure out their 
            biases, so that they can understand how to counteract this.
