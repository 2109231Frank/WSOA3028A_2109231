                <h2>USABILITY & ACCESSIBILITY ON THE WEB</h2>
        <p>
                What is usability and accessibility? First I am going to take a look at usability, this describes a user's
                overall experience when interacting with a product or system. This includes efficiency of completing tasks 
                and user-satisfaction and is a immensly important aspect of websites, seeing that usability can dictate 
                whether users will return to a website or not. Accessibility isn't far from usability seeing that it also 
                influences user experience and overall satisfaction. Accessibility is different than usability in the sense 
                that it focuses more on user empowerment; what I mean by this is
                that, for example a product with good accessibility will allow a user with a disability to use said product just as
                easily as a user that doesn't have a disability. This is important, because it removes a lot of stress and frustrations
                from the user experience when the accessibility is implemented properly.
        </p>
        <p>
                When looking at usability on the web we can see that one of the main principles that influence web usability is infact,
                accessibility. This is because through designing a site with accessibility in mind we create a site that is simple and
                easy to use by default. In order to have a site with good usability, there are a few thing we need to have; Firstly 
                we need to make sure that everything works properly. This includes hyperlinks, images, and good, reliable hosting. The
                next thing that you are going to want in your website is clarity, in other words you are going to need a design that
                results in your users knowing exactly how to navigate and use your site. The key to good usabilty is product testing,
                you are going to want to create prototype after prototype after prototype and test all of these vigorously in order to
                find out what works for you specifically.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many ways to implement accessibility into your website. There are many things that one can code into your website,
            for example you can ensure that your websute is working properly on all devices (laptops, desktops, smartphones and tablets)
            this will greatly increase the amount of people who will be able to use your website. What about people with disabilities? 
            well there are tools that you can use to allow them to use your site too. By implementing proper semantic-markup you can ensure
            that text to speech software can easily and effectively read your site aloud, allowing blind users to access and use your site.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many more examples of how to implement usability and accessibility to websites, but through these few I gave above
            I hope that you can understand why usability and accessibility is an important aspect of the web. Without these two principles
            alot less people could use the web and alot of people who could, would have trouble navigating and using the internet.
