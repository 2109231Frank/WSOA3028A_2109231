        <p>In “the medium is the message” by Marshall McLuhan, it is explained that, basically, the medium through which a message is<br>
        communicated sometimes holds a message itself, and this message is sometimes more important than the one being communicated.<br>
        This means that consumers have presumptions about the message because of its medium, for example we all expect a movie to be<br>
        a linear experience, it will have a beginning, a middle, a climax and an end. The internet as a medium is very unique seeing<br>
        that consumers choose how they want to consume information (they can read through multiple webpages at once, start in the<br>
        middle of a page and go form there or they can consume a webpage start to finish as its presented).<br></p>
        
        <p>This reading by McLuhan has brought me to think differently with regards to designing for the web seeing that I have always<br>
        thought that in order to be successful on the internet all you have to do is design an appealing webpage that follows the<br>
        trends that are popular at the time. Now, however, I understand that consumers have pre-existing expectations of the web and<br>
        how information is going to be presented, I understand that we as designers need to respect the fact that the solutions or<br>
        information that is provided by the web can reach anyone around the world, and that our design choices shape pieces of the<br>
        medium thus changing the message entirely.<br></p>
        
        <p>In short, the medium of a message shapes how consumers absorb said message and the web is a powerful medium that can be used<br>
        to shape messages in many ways. Web designers need to understand this so they can take advantage and get information across<br>
        as effectively as possible.<br></p>
