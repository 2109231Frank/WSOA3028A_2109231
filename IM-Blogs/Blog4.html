                <h2>THE MEDIUM IS THE MESSAGE</h2>
        <p>In “the medium is the message” by Marshall McLuhan, it is explained that, basically, the medium through which a message is
        communicated sometimes holds a message itself, and this message is sometimes more important than the one being communicated.
        This means that consumers have presumptions about the message because of its medium, for example we all expect a movie to be
        a linear experience, it will have a beginning, a middle, a climax and an end. The internet as a medium is very unique seeing
        that consumers choose how they want to consume information (they can read through multiple webpages at once, start in the
        middle of a page and go form there or they can consume a webpage start to finish as its presented).</p>
        
        <p>This reading by McLuhan has brought me to think differently with regards to designing for the web seeing that I have always
        thought that in order to be successful on the internet all you have to do is design an appealing webpage that follows the
        trends that are popular at the time. Now, however, I understand that consumers have pre-existing expectations of the web and
        how information is going to be presented, I understand that we as designers need to respect the fact that the solutions or
        information that is provided by the web can reach anyone around the world, and that our design choices shape pieces of the
        medium thus changing the message entirely.</p>
        
        <p>In short, the medium of a message shapes how consumers absorb said message and the web is a powerful medium that can be used
        to shape messages in many ways. Web designers need to understand this so they can take advantage and get information across
        as effectively as possible.</p>
